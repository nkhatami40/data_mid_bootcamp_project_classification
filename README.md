# data_mid_bootcamp_project_classification

The objective of this project is to analise the characteristics of the bank customers that accept or reject a credit card offer, and predict customers behaviour in this regard.

With that end in mind, we studied a dataframe with information about 18000 bank customers using three different tools: Python, SQL and Tableau.

We performed exploratory data analysis to identify which features are related to the acceptance or otherwise of the credit card offer, and used machine learning techniques for classification with the objective of predicting the consumers behaviour.
